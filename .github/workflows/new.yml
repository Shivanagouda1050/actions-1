jobs:
  shell_script_added:          # Name of the job (you can have multiple jobs in one workflow)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest     # The job runs inside a fresh Ubuntu VM hosted by GitHub

    steps:                     # A job is made up of steps (executed one by one)
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository into the runner
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4   # Official GitHub Action that pulls your repo files into the VM

      # Step 2: Run some basic shell commands

        run: |
          echo "My first Github Actions Job"  # Print a welcome message
          ls -ltra                            # List all files in current directory (detailed view, sorted by time)
          cat README.md                       # Display contents of README.md file

      # Step 3: Make sure our script has execution permissions
      - name: Make script executable
        run: chmod +x .github/workflows/samplescript.sh   # Add +x (execute) permission

      # Step 4: Run the custom shell script
